#  This program demonstrates comparisons of numbers, using Boolean expressions.
#

x = float(input("Enter a number (such as 3.5 or 4.5): "))
y = float(input("Enter a second number: "))

if     : # 1. Insert a comparison that tests for equality 
   print("They are the same.")
else : 
   if  :  # 2. Insert a comparison that tests x is greater than y
      print("The first number is larger")
   else :
      print("The first number is smaller")

   if  :  # 3. Insert a comparison that tests x and y have a difference of 0.1 or less y
      print("The numbers are close together")

   if  : # 4. Insert a comparison that tests x and y are exactly 1 apart
      print("The numbers are one apart")

   if  : # 5. Insert a comparison that testsif x and y are the same sign
      print("The numbers have the same sign")
   else :
      print("The numbers have different signs")
